# Feeder


FEEDER project includes PCB and schematics design. The circuit consists of ATMEGA329P AU mcu, HX711 amplifier for load cell and UA2003 stepper motor driver. There are several programming codes for different operations.
One of the operation is to just drive stepper driver. The arduino IDE file is STEPPERDRIVERFORFEEDER. 
Other operation is to set 2 schedules to feed animals at specific weight of the food. the load cell can be calibrated if button is pressed. This IDE file is fsmwithtime.
